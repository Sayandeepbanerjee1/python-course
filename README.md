# Python
## Designed by: *Guido Van Russom*
### First appeared: 20 February 1991
- Genral Purpose
- Easy to Learn
- Object Oriented
- Has high level data structures
- Dynamically typed
- Scripting Language
- Versatile Domains(Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning etc)
- **Interpreter**

### Python syntax
```python
# Print the classic "Hello World" message to the console, showcasing a simple output operation.
print('Hello World')
# Print the result of the arithmetic operation 1 + 2, demonstrating basic math and the `print` function.
print(1+2)
# Assign a string value to the variable `greet`. This demonstrates variable initialization and string handling.
greet = "Welcome To our Course"
# Check if the value of the `greet` variable matches the string "Good Morning". Demonstrates an `if` statement for conditional logic.
if greet=="Good Morning":
    # If the condition is true, this line executes and prints "Good Morning" to the console.
    print("Good Morning")
else:
    # If the condition is false, this line executes and prints "Learn and Contribute" to the console.
    print("Learn and Contribute")
```

- Output

```
Hello World
3
Learn and Contribute
````

> [!Note]
> # Indenation in Python
> Indentation in Python refers to the **spaces or tabs** at the beginning of a code line. Unlike many programming languages that use braces {} or other delimiters to define code blocks, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. This makes Python code more readable and visually structured.
> - It is a part of the syntax
> - Indentation is not optional in Python
> - Improper indentation leads to a **IndentationError**
> - Each nested block increases the indentation level.
> - Use the **same number of spaces (or tabs)** for all lines in a block.


# ATOMS
Atoms are the smallest units of Python syntax that cannot be broken down further.
